\usage{
pkg_startup_msg(libname, pkgname)
}
\arguments{
\item{libname}{\emph{a character string giving the library directory where the package defining the namespace was found.}}

\item{pkgname}{\emph{a character string giving the name of the package.}}
}
\description{
The \code{pkg_startup_msg()} function generates a structured and styled startup
message that includes:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The package name and version.
\item The current Git branch, if applicable.
\item Dependencies listed in the package's \code{DESCRIPTION} file.
\item The library path from which the package was loaded.
}

The function checks if the current working directory is part of a Git repository using
\verb{git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree}. If a Git repository is detected, it retrieves the
active branch name with \verb{git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD}. Errors during this process
are handled gracefully.
Package dependencies, including \code{Imports}, \code{Suggests}, and \code{Depends}, are read from the
\code{DESCRIPTION} file and formatted into a user-friendly list.
The function uses the \href{https://cli.r-lib.org/}{cli} package to create a well-structured
and styled startup message, enhancing the user experience with concise, informative output.
